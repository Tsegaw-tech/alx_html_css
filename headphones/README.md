# Headphones Landing Page

## 📄 Project Overview  
This is the **Headphones** landing page project — part of the **ALX Front-End Web Development** curriculum. The goal is to turn a detailed **Figma design** into a responsive, user-friendly HTML/CSS page that matches the mockups and interaction specs.

You can view the design here:

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By building this project, you will:
- Interpret and replicate a Figma design using HTML & CSS  
- Use semantic HTML5 tags for structure  
- Apply responsive design with CSS media queries  
- Implement hover/active states and other interactions  
- Enforce consistency in typography, spacing, and layout  

---

## 🧷 Design & Interaction Specs

- **Max content width:** `1000px`, centered on the page  
- **Responsive breakpoint:** `480px` (switch to mobile layout)  
- **Link hover / active color:** `#FF6565`  
- **Button hover / active effect:** `opacity: 0.9`  
- **Fonts used:**  
  - Source Sans Pro  
  - Spin Cycle OT  
- **Color palette, spacing, and element sizes** should match the Figma file  

> _Some design values may be in floats — you can round them where reasonable._

## 📱 Responsive Design Behavior

| Device      | Max Width | Layout Behavior                                      |
|-------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Desktop     | ≥ 480px     | Full layout, centered within 1000px width container     |
| Mobile / Small | ≤ 480px | Switches to a mobile-friendly layout (stacked, simpler) |

## 🔁 Interactivity & Feedback

- **Links** (e.g. navigation, section links):  
  On *hover* or *active*, their color should change to `#FF6565`.

- **Buttons** (e.g. “Buy now”, “Learn more”):  
  On *hover* or *active*, their opacity changes to `0.9` (i.e. slightly dimmed).

- Use **smooth transitions** (e.g. `transition: 0.2s ease-in-out`) to make state changes feel natural.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project uses:

- **HTML5** — for semantic, structured markup  
- **CSS3** — including flexbox, media queries, and responsive techniques  
- **Figma** — for design reference and style specification
